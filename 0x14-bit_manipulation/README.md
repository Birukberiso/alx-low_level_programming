# Bit Manipulation Tasks

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to bit manipulation.

## Tasks

### Task 0: `convert_binary`

A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. The function prototype is `unsigned int convert_binary(const char *b);`.

### Task 1: `binary_to_uint`

A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. The function prototype is `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`.

### Task 2: `print_binary`

A function that prints the binary representation of a number. The function prototype is `void print_binary(unsigned long int n);`.

### Task 3: `get_bit`

A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. The function prototype is `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);`.

### Task 4: `set_bit`

A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. The function prototype is `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`.

### Task 5: `clear_bit`

A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. The function prototype is `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`.

### Task 6: `flip_bits`

A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. The function prototype is `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);`.

### Task 7: `get_endianness`

A function that checks the endianness. The function prototype is `int get_endianness(void);`.

## Compilation

All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
